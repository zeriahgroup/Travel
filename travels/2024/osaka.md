We had a trip in April 2024, these are the main trip details.

## Pre Trip Preparations

Reading materials and video guides:

- https://insideosaka.com/
- https://www.insidekyoto.com/

Getting a eSIM card for the trip:

- https://www.klook.com/activity/109393-japan-esim-high-speed-internet-qr-code-voucher/

Pre booking of restaurants and attractions:

- **[Kobe beef Wanomiya Namba Oriental Hotel](https://jpneazy.com/restaurants/104)** (steak restaurant in Osaka)
- **[Hokuto GEMS Namba](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14134988-d15614898-Reviews-Hokuto_GEMS_Namba-Namba_Chuo_Osaka_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html)** (nice sukiyaki restaurant)
- **[Sagano Romantic Train Ticket](https://ars-saganokanko.triplabo.jp/home)** (after that you can go for a walk in the Bamboo Forest)
- **[Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan Ticket](https://www.klook.com/activity/598-osaka-aquarium-kaiyukan-japan/)** (**[YouTube guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4a2X_frKZM&t=2s)**)
- **[Limousine bus transfer from Airport to Osaka or Namba Station](https://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/18203-kansai-airport-one-way-transfer-osaka/)**
- Book your hotels, obviously. Personally I like **[Hotel Monterey Grasmere Osaka](https://www.hotelmonterey.co.jp/en/grasmere_osaka/)**.  
  For Kyoto, we stayed at **[Hotel Keihan Kyoto Ekiminami](https://kyotoekiminami.hotelkeihan.co.jp/)** (across from Kyoto Station, breakfast included).
- Kimono rentals + photographer package if you want photoshoots
- Shinkansen tickets if you want to secure a seat
- Ideally you might want a **[Suica card](https://www.klook.com/en-SG/blog/welcome-suica-card-guide/)** for easier commuting
- If you plan properly, the **[Osaka Amazing Pass](https://osaka-amazing-pass.com/en/info.html)** might save money

## Day 1 - Singapore to Osaka Kansai Airport

Fun fact — did you know that Kansai Airport is **sinking**?

- https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/how-to-save-a-sinking-airport-180968985/
- http://www.kansai-airports.co.jp/en/efforts/our-tech/kix/sink/sink3.html
- https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/osakas-sinking-kansai-airport-to-raise-runway-after-last-years-flooding-by-typhoon

If you've bought a **physical sim card from Klook**, gentle reminder to redeem it from the Cheers counter when you reach the airport:

- https://www.changiairport.com/en/shop/shopping-directory/cheers.html

The flight from Singapore to Osaka takes about **6 hours and 40 minutes**. Upon reaching Kansai Airport, set up your eSIM and collect the tickets for the limousine bus.

Please note buses keep a **very strict timetable** — check the departure time:
- **Kansai Airport → Namba Station timetable:** https://www.kate.co.jp/en/timetable/detail/OC

Also, there’s a limit to how many hand-carry luggage are permitted per passenger (usually 2 per passenger is ok).

*Depending on what time you leave the airport and board the bus, the commute varies between 50 to 80 minutes.*

In our case: 8.30am flight → arrived ~4.10pm Osaka time → limousine bus 5pm → reached Namba ~6pm. Dinner was 6.30pm, so we had enough time to walk to Hokuto GEMS Namba (~8 minutes).

Restaurant is nice, staff is friendly, food is good. It’s awesome. (**[Tripadvisor link](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g14134988-d15614898-Reviews-Hokuto_GEMS_Namba-Namba_Chuo_Osaka_Osaka_Prefecture_Kinki.html?m=19905)**)

For parents travelling with kids: you can buy diapers at the supermarket next to **[Hotel Monterey Grasmere Osaka](https://www.hotelmonterey.co.jp/en/grasmere_osaka/)** — cheaper than lugging from Singapore.

Check in after shopping, and sleep.  
Day 1 ends.

## Day 2 - Legoland, Osaka Aquarium and Tempozan Giant Ferris Wheel

![](https://restfulincreaseacademy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/funtimes_20240708_133520_00002505268343995173958.jpg?w=1024)

To be honest, Legoland isn’t that exciting and is a bit small — you can skip unless you want to max out your Osaka Amazing Pass.

Cost comparison for Day 1 and Day 2:

| Itinerary | Location | Cost | Remarks | Osaka Amazing pass |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Day 1 | Hotel to Legoland | 290¥ | Commute | Included |
|  | **[Legoland](https://www.legolanddiscoverycenter.com/osaka/en/tickets-passes/)** | 2,200¥ | Partially covered | Subsidized 1,700¥ |
|  | **[Osaka Aquarium](https://www.kaiyukan.com/language/eng/ticket.html)** | 2,700¥ | Not covered | 2,700¥ |
|  | Tempozan Giant Ferris Wheel | 900¥ |  | Included |
|  | Tempozan back to Hotel | 290¥ | Commute | Included |
| Day 2 | Hotel to Osaka Castle | 240¥ | Commute | Included |
|  | Osaka Castle | 600¥ |  | Included |
|  | **[Gozabune Boat Ride](https://www.banpr.co.jp/%E5%A4%A7%E9%98%AA%E5%9F%8E%E5%BE%A1%E5%BA%A7%E8%88%B9/)** | 700¥ |  | Included |
|  | Osaka Castle Nishimatsuya Gardens | Free |  | Free |
|  | Osaka Castle to Hotel | 240¥ | Commute | Included |
|  | **Grand Total (per adult)** | **8,160¥** |  | **9,900¥** |

*Note: these are July 2024 prices.*

Versus a **[2 day Osaka Amazing Pass](https://osaka-amazing-pass.com/en/howto_about_1day.html)** (5,500¥), the pass might be cheaper if you’re more ambitious and do more activities; otherwise customize your trip.

Legoland can skip. (**[YouTube Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yl6aSXwscA)**)

Osaka Aquarium is impressive. (**[YouTube guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4a2X_frKZM&t=2s)**)

Morning breakfast options were plentiful — we went to Rita Coffee:

![](https://restfulincreaseacademy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240429_093700.jpg?w=766)

Thereafter we made our way to Legoland:

[![](https://restfulincreaseacademy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-3.png?w=599)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z7MZoJDnV1M6JPGJ6)

The Osaka Amazing Pass lets you take the Yotsubashi Line + Chuo Line, saving time (no need to queue for tickets).

Legoland, Aquarium, Ferris Wheel are all in the same area — walkable.

Dinner was damn good:

Kobe beef with crazy marbling — book early: **[Wanomiya](https://jpneazy.com/restaurants/104)**

Day 2 ends.

## Day 3 - Osaka Castle, and travelling to Kyoto

If you Google “Osaka Castle Pond”, you’ll see this famous shot:

![](https://restfulincreaseacademy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-5.png?w=1024)

It’s a nice photo spot — keep an eye out for it.

[![](https://restfulincreaseacademy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-6.png?w=599)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2BViPf47rAac2Yi68)

Commute is easy: Yotsubashi Line → Chuo Line. There’s some walking and mild upslope but manageable.

After the castle, you can go to Nishimatsuya (kids/baby clothes):

[![](https://restfulincreaseacademy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-8.png?w=600)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EFoR7etyTB8XFKjLA)

We headed back to pack and travel to Kyoto. We left some luggage with Hotel Monterey Grasmere Osaka and collected it later (less lugging).

[![](https://restfulincreaseacademy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-10.png?w=599)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/btTPXharpmnWg35H9)

You can **[pre-book Haruka tickets via Klook](https://www.klook.com/en-SG/activity/18400-jr-haruka-airport-express-train-tickets-osaka/)** for reserved seats.

Kyoto Station has a free mini attraction in the evening:
- **["Aqua Fantasy"](https://www.tripadvisor.com/FAQ_Answers-g298564-d11719581-t6920142-Hours_open.html)**

Then check in to **[Hotel Keihan Kyoto Ekiminami](https://kyotoekiminami.hotelkeihan.co.jp/)** and sleep.  
Day 3 ends.

## Day 4 - Kimono photoshoot and exploring Gion district

[![](https://restfulincreaseacademy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-11.png?w=601)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eJCbFyska9oE3PgU8)

Breakfast was included. After that we took a bus to the Kimono rental shop. After changing, it’s a short walk to **[Yasaka Shrine](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3903.html)** for photos.

We ended the day at **[Pontocho Restaurants Street](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurants-g298564-zfn8277484-Kyoto_Kyoto_Prefecture_Kinki.html)** (many places need reservations).

## Day 5 - Iconic Kiyomizu Temple and Fushimi Inari-Taisha Shrine

Day 5 and Day 6 are designed to break your legs — be mentally prepared.

Day 6 = lots of walking.

[![](https://restfulincreaseacademy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-17.png?w=601)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NQ99qeQuunEvVPip8)

The train drops you near the Bamboo Forest for a nice walk before lunch.

**[Tenryu-ji](https://www.tenryuji.com/en/)** is a UNESCO World Heritage Site — worth visiting.

## Day 7 - Osaka to Nara Park and back to Osaka

Short trip to Nara to say hi to the deer.

Deer snacks: you can buy to support the uncle, but the deer are kind of sick of it unless very hungry.

## Day 8 - Universal Studios Osaka

[![](https://restfulincreaseacademy.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot_20240708_134526_googleplaystore6902470535736453658.jpg?w=1024)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.universalstudios.japanresort)

Did you remember to bring your Harry Potter wand and Gryffindor scarf?

Download the **[Universal Studios Japan app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.universalstudios.japanresort)** and book tickets early.
